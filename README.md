Small Python Code to sum up all XML validation Files of German Bundesbank for the proper analytics of the whole timeline.
The input folder can contain as many XML files as wished. It's recommended to use one file per reporting month.
The original XML names by Bundesbank shouldn't be changed!

Sheet 1 contains all valdiation rules with their frequency on a monthly basis with the reporting month and the date of validation (date file sent by Bundesbank).
Sheet 2 sums up all valdidation rules with their frequency on the whole timeline.
